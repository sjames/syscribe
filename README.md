# Syscribe

> Markdown-native SysMLv2 modeling — human-readable, agent-native, version-controlled, and traceable across the whole life of a program.

## The Idea

Systems modeling tools have traditionally been built around proprietary binary formats or complex XML schemas. They are powerful but opaque — hard for humans to read in raw form, and nearly impossible for LLMs to generate or reason about reliably.

Syscribe maps SysMLv2 semantics onto plain Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Every model element is a `.md` file. The directory structure encodes the namespace hierarchy. YAML frontmatter declares the element type and its structural relationships. The Markdown body is the documentation.

```

  System/
    Software/
      SafetyMonitor.md      # part def, ASIL D
      ThrottleControl.md
  Requirements/
    Safety/
      REQ-ENG-SAFE-001.md   # native Requirement with stable ID
  Verification/
    TC-ENG-SAFE-002.md      # TestCase with Gherkin scenarios
  Decisions/
    ADR-ENG-SAFE-001.md     # Architecture Decision Record
```

```yaml

```

## Why This Format Is Interesting

**For humans** — every element is a readable, diffable, grep-able text file. Edit in any editor, navigate with standard file tools, review in any git diff viewer.

**For LLMs** — Markdown and YAML are what large language models handle best. An LLM can generate a complete model from a natural-language description, add requirements, or trace a safety goal to test cases — all by reading and writing plain files. The built-in prompt (`syscribe --agent-instructions`) gives an LLM everything it needs to produce valid models.

**For teams** — the model lives in a git repository alongside the code. Pull requests, blame, branches, and merges all work as expected.

**For external tools** — because every element is a separate file, it has a stable URL in any git host. A GitHub permalink to `model_auto/Requirements/Safety/REQ-ENG-SAFE-001.md` points to that exact requirement at that exact commit forever. JIRA tickets, Confluence pages, code review comments, and CI reports can all link directly to a specific requirement, test case, or architecture decision — at the branch tip, at a release tag, or pinned to a specific commit hash.

## What It Supports

- **40+ element types** covering SysMLv2 structural, behavioral, and requirements constructs
- **Native Requirement** elements (REQ-* stable IDs) with SIL/ASIL, lifecycle status, domain classification, derivation trees
- **Native TestCase** elements (TC-* IDs) with L1–L5 test levels and Gherkin scenarios
- **Architecture Decision Records** (ADR-*) — every requirement decomposition cites an accepted ADR
- **Safety analysis**: HARA, SafetyGoal, HazardousEvent, FaultTree (file-per-node), FMEA (exploded entries)
- **Security analysis**: TARA, DamageScenario, ThreatScenario, CybersecurityGoal, SecurityControl, VulnerabilityReport
- **Variability / product lines**: feature models (`FeatureDef`, `Configuration`), `appliesWhen:` conditioning, SAT-backed `feature-check`, and the `--config` projection lens
- **Multi-repository composition** (§14): import namespaces from peer repos via `[repos]` + `repoImports:`, resolve cross-repo references by global stable ID, and gate reproducibility on git ref drift / submodule gitlink (`W510`–`W512`)
- **Hierarchical product lines** (§14.7): a `Configuration` consolidates already-configured lower-tier `Configuration`s — local or in a `[repos]`-mounted product-line repo, at any depth — via `subConfigurations:`, with parameter bindings resolved across tiers (`examples/hple-multitier/`)
- **Work tracking** — native `PlanningItem` (`PI-*`) epics/stories/tasks tied to the `Requirement`s they achieve, with evidence-backed `done`, `blockedBy:`, `assignedTo:`, `syscribe set` for status/evidence edits, and `claim` / `release` advisory ownership for concurrent multi-agent work
- **User-defined link types** — declare project relationships (`mitigates`, `conflictsWith`, …) as `[linkTypes.*]` in `.syscribe.toml` with source/target types, cardinality and acyclicity; author them under `links:`, list the vocabulary with `link-types`, and walk them with `follow`
- **Foreign sources in one graph** — native SysMLv2 textual submodels (`sysmlSubmodel:`), any custom notation through stdio-subprocess plugins (`foreignFormat:`), and elements declared in ordinary source-code comments (`annotationFormat:`), all validated and traced like hand-written elements
- **IEC 62443 zones & conduits**, **review records**, **trade studies**, and **state-machine / sequence completeness** checks
- **Seven §12 traceability rules** enforced by the validator: OSLC link direction, breakdown ADR, leaf assignment, domain classification, HW/SW independence, deployment allocation, implementation trace (`implementedBy:`)
- **200+ validation rules** across parse-time, cross-reference, safety/security, behavior, and composition: cross-reference resolution, integrity level consistency, diagram annotation, documentation completeness
- **Suspect links** — content-baseline (`traceBaselines:`, BLAKE3) detection of *stale* trace links: when a reviewed relationship's target changes, it surfaces as `W090` and is cleared by re-review (`suspect accept`)
- **Release baselines** — first-class, git-anchored, content-hashed frozen release snapshots (`Baseline`, `BL-*`) with drift detection, scoped to the whole model, a package, a product-line variant, or a safety goal's trace closure
- **MCP server** — `syscribe mcp` exposes structured tools to LLM agents: read/query/trace/validate plus *guarded* writes (dry-run → validation delta → referential-integrity commit gate)
- **LSP server** — `syscribe lsp` gives editors live diagnostics and model-aware navigation over stdio (a VS Code extension lives in `editors/vscode/`)
- **Static HTML export** — `syscribe export-html` renders the whole model as a standalone, offline site for reviewers without the toolchain
- **Diagrams** — server-rendered SVG, client-side Mermaid, an editable diagram view in the web UI, and PlantUML companion generation/rendering
- **Coverage & product-line matrices** — Requirement × Configuration coverage grids, variant-aware verification depth, SAT-backed feature analysis
- **LLM-scale corpus tools** — `stats` / `digest` / `search-text` / `summarize` / `topics` / `clusters` for navigating large models, plus `impact` change analysis and ReqIF/SBOM export

## Traceability That Survives Change

Static validation answers *"is the model internally consistent right now?"* Syscribe also answers the two questions that matter across the life of a safety program.

**Has a reviewed link gone stale?** A trace link (`verifies`, `derivedFrom`, `satisfies`, …) asserts a relationship that was valid *when a human reviewed it*. `suspect accept` captures a BLAKE3 hash of the target's normative content; if the target later changes, the link surfaces as `W090` (*suspect*) so it can be re-reviewed. Editorial edits are excluded, so the signal is low-noise and version-control-agnostic — a precise flag that one specific reviewed relationship needs re-confirmation.

```bash
syscribe -m model_auto/ suspect list                          # suspect + un-baselined links
syscribe -m model_auto/ suspect accept TC-ENG-SAFE-002 REQ-ENG-SAFE-001
syscribe -m model_auto/ validate --deny W090                  # gate CI on stale links
```

**What exactly was released, and can you prove it hasn't changed?** A `Baseline` (`BL-*`) freezes a scope of the model into a git-anchored, content-hashed release an assessor can point to directly. The scope is the whole model, a package subtree, a projected product-line variant (`config=`), or the trace closure of one safety goal (`closureFrom=`). A **released** baseline is frozen: any change to its sealed content is a hard error (`E520`); `verify` re-proves the content hash *and* the git tag↔commit; `diff` shows exactly what changed between two releases.

```bash
syscribe -m model_auto/ baseline create --tag REL-2026-07 --approver "J. Roe"
syscribe -m model_auto/ baseline verify --all                 # CI gate: content + git proof
syscribe -m model_auto/ baseline diff BL-2026-06 BL-2026-07   # what changed between releases
```

Together these turn a git-controlled model into an **audit trail**: every relationship is either confirmed-current or flagged for review, and every release is a provable, comparable snapshot.

## Agent-Native — the MCP Server

Syscribe is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so an LLM agent works with the model as a first-class client — reading, analyzing, and *safely writing* it — not just generating files from a prompt.

```bash
syscribe -m model_auto/ mcp                # stdio MCP server (`syscribe help mcp` lists the tools)
syscribe -m model_auto/ mcp --read-only    # analysis only; write tools hidden & refused
```

Read tools cover retrieval, fuzzy search, the containment/graph, `trace` / `impact`, validation, coverage, and the suspect/baseline surfaces. **Writes are guarded**: every `create_element` / `update_element` / `move_element` / `delete_element` / `apply_changes` call defaults to `dry_run: true`, returns the **validation delta** the change would cause (newly introduced and resolved errors and warnings), and refuses to commit anything that would break referential integrity — so an agent can propose a change, inspect its exact effect, and only then commit it. Sealing a release stays a deliberate CLI/CI action.

## Installation

**Prebuilt binaries.** Each [GitHub release](https://github.com/sjames/syscribe/releases) ships a standalone `syscribe` CLI binary, named `syscribe-<target>` (`.exe` on Windows):

| Platform | Asset |
|---|---|
| Linux x86_64 | `syscribe-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| Linux aarch64 | `syscribe-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| macOS Intel | `syscribe-x86_64-apple-darwin` |
| macOS Apple silicon | `syscribe-aarch64-apple-darwin` |
| Windows x86_64 | `syscribe-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` |

```bash
curl -fsSL -o syscribe \
  https://github.com/sjames/syscribe/releases/latest/download/syscribe-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
chmod +x syscribe
```

**From source.** The web server (`syscribe-server`) is not a release asset — build it from source (Rust stable):

```bash
cargo build --workspace            # target/debug/syscribe and target/debug/syscribe-server
cargo install --path crates/syscribe          # or install either binary
cargo install --path crates/syscribe-server
```

**In GitHub Actions.** The repository is also a reusable action that downloads the release binary for the runner and validates a model:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: sjames/syscribe@v0
  with:
    model-path: model/          # default
    version: latest             # or a release tag, e.g. v0.40.1
    args: --deny W090           # extra arguments to `validate`
    fail-on-warnings: false
    upload-report: true         # upload the report as a workflow artifact
```

It exposes `errors` and `warnings` counts as step outputs. See the [CI/CD guide](https://sjames.github.io/syscribe/guides/cicd/) for more.

## Running

### Validate a model

The model root is set with `-m` / `--model`, or via the `SYSCRIBE_MODEL` environment variable:

```bash
# Full validation report
syscribe -m model_auto/

# Findings only
syscribe -m model_auto/ validate

# Machine-readable JSON output
syscribe -m model_auto/ validate --json

# Scoped to a single file
syscribe -m model_auto/ validate --file model_auto/System/Software/SafetyMonitor.md

# CI gating — exit 0 (clean) / 1 (errors) / 2 (gated warnings)
syscribe -m model_auto/ validate --deny W004,W009    # named warnings become fatal
syscribe -m model_auto/ validate --max-warnings 0    # any warning fails the build
syscribe -m model_auto/ validate --warnings-as-errors

# Fetch & verify remote sourceFiles via the .syscribe.toml [remote] hook (opt-in)
syscribe -m model_auto/ validate --fetch-remote
```

`sourceFile:` values resolve by form — bare/`model:` (model root), `repo:` (repo root), absolute, `file://`, or a remote `scheme://` URI. Remote URIs are accepted unverified by default; with a `[remote] download` hook in `.syscribe.toml` and `--fetch-remote`, they are downloaded (cached under `.syscribe/cache/`) and checked like local files. The hook only runs with the explicit flag.

### Query the model

```bash
# Trace a requirement end-to-end
syscribe -m model_auto/ trace REQ-ENG-SAFE-001

# What does this component satisfy?
syscribe -m model_auto/ why System::Software::SafetyMonitor

# Who tests this requirement?
syscribe -m model_auto/ who-verifies REQ-ENG-SAFE-001

# All relationships on an element (impact analysis)
syscribe -m model_auto/ links System::Software::SafetyMonitor

# Next available stable ID
syscribe -m model_auto/ next-id REQ-ENG-SAFE

# Fuzzy search across names, IDs, and docs
syscribe -m model_auto/ find throttle

# Requirement × Configuration coverage grid (variant-aware)
syscribe -m model_auto/ matrix

# Upstream / downstream impact of changing an element
syscribe -m model_auto/ impact REQ-ENG-SAFE-001
```

### Refactor: move an element or package

`move` relocates an element (or a whole package subtree) to a new qualified name and atomically rewrites every reference to it — frontmatter (including nested `connections`/`features`), multi-segment qualified names cited in Markdown bodies, and SVG diagram references (inline and companion `.svg` files: `sysml:ref`/`data-qname`/`href`). Stable IDs (`REQ-*`, `TC-*`, `ADR-*`) and references made through them are preserved.

```bash
# Preview the file move and every reference update — writes nothing
syscribe -m model_auto/ move System::Software::SafetyMonitor System::Safety::SafetyMonitor --dry-run

# Apply it (all-or-nothing; rolls back on any error)
syscribe -m model_auto/ move System::Software::SafetyMonitor System::Safety::SafetyMonitor
```

### Export the model graph

For CI gates, dashboards, and LLM agents that need the whole model without re-parsing Markdown:

```bash
# Versioned JSON document (schemaVersion + elements[] with typed frontmatter
# and resolved relationships: computed.verifiedBy / derivedChildren)
syscribe -m model_auto/ export

# Newline-delimited JSON (header line, then one element per line)
syscribe -m model_auto/ export --ndjson
```

Each element carries `qname`, `file`, `id`, `type`, `name`, its typed `frontmatter`, and — for requirements — a `computed` block with the resolved `verifiedBy` and `derivedChildren` reverse indices.

### Diagrams

```bash
# Generate PlantUML companion files, then render them to SVG
# (needs `plantuml` on PATH or PLANTUML_JAR set)
syscribe -m model_auto/ plantuml
syscribe -m model_auto/ plantuml render
```

Diagrams also render live in the web UI — server-side SVG plus client-side Mermaid — where non-Mermaid diagrams can be edited directly (create, connect, move, delete; every edit is validated before it is written).

### Browse in a web UI

```bash
syscribe-server -m model_auto/
# open http://localhost:3000   (tree browser, element detail, diagrams)
```

The server watches the model directory and reloads automatically on file changes.

### In-terminal format spec

```bash
syscribe spec               # table of contents
syscribe spec types         # all element types
syscribe spec validation    # all validation rule codes
syscribe spec traceability  # traceability rules
```

### Version

```bash
syscribe --version          # also -V, or `syscribe version` → "syscribe <semver>"
```

## Demo Models

| Model | Domain | Standards / method |
|---|---|---|
| `model_auto/` | Automotive Engine ECU | ISO 26262 (ASIL D), ISO/SAE 21434, AUTOSAR SecOC |
| `model_sil/` | SIL 4 Railway Interlocking | IEC 61508, EN 50128/50129, EN 50159 Cat 2 |
| `model/` | UAV Autonomous Flight System | General SysMLv2 element palette |
| `model_mg/` | EV DC Fast-Charging Station | MagicGrid (problem/solution × 4 pillars) |

All four demo models validate with 0 errors and demonstrate full requirements traceability, safety analysis (HARA, FTA, FMEA), and security analysis (TARA); CI gates on `validate` for every model.

## LLM Authoring

```bash
# Print the generation prompt
syscribe --agent-instructions

# Use it directly with your LLM tool
syscribe --agent-instructions | llm "Create a brake-by-wire model for ISO 26262 ASIL D"
```

The prompt and the validator are always in sync — `--agent-instructions` is embedded at compile time from `prompts/create-model.md`. For interactive, guarded authoring where the agent inspects each change before committing, run the [MCP server](#agent-native--the-mcp-server) instead. See the [LLM Workflow guide](https://sjames.github.io/syscribe/model-guide/llm-workflow/) for the full incremental authoring workflow.

## Prior Work

Syscribe is an evolution of [assemblyline](https://github.com/sjames/assemblyline), an earlier experiment in structured systems modeling that used [Typst](https://typst.app) as the modeling language. Typst worked well for rendering and was extensible, but the language was unnecessarily complex for the authoring use case — requiring toolchain knowledge just to read or write a model element.

Markdown + YAML removes that barrier entirely. No special tools are needed to write or read the content. If you host the model on GitHub, the files render as-is. The ideas from assemblyline are reimplemented here in a format that any editor, any diff viewer, and any LLM can handle natively.
